When creating a ticket in the osTicket system, we see the form to fill out the ticket. We first select the user(s) and ticket notice. Then we input the ticket information and options. The  fields are the source, topic departments,  SLA plan, due date and assignee. From there we input the Ticket details. This inlcudes the issue summary and space for a description of the issue.
